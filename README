    Piece
        |_> size
        |_> color/team/player?
    Board
        |_> isGameOver()
        |_> currBoardStatus
    Move
        |_> isLegalMove(player, board)
            |_> can piece overtake this piece
            |_> does player have the piece to make Move
        |_> returnNewBoardStatus()
