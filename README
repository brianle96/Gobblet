This is a personal project based on the following game found on Reddit

https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/nkupcu/upgraded_tic_tac_toe/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Rules:

- Be the first player to align 3 gobblets in a row

- In turns, players can either put a new gobblets
  already on the board to any empty space or 
  gobble up any smaller size enemy gobblet with a 
  bigger gobblet already in play 

- If you place all 6 of your pieces on the board
  before the game is over, you simply continue playing
  with the pieces on the board until a winner
  or a draw is declared
